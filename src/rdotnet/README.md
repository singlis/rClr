R.NET
=======

R.NET enables the .NET Framework to interoperate with the R statistical language in the same process. R.NET works on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

# Software requirements

On Windows, R.NET requires .NET Framework 4 or later and an access to the native R libraries installed with the R environment. R needs not necessarily be installed as a software on the exec uting machine, so long as DLL files are accessible.
On Linux and MacOS, Mono is required, as well as an access to the native R libraries.
